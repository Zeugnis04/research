## Introduction

The Indian subcontinent has long been shaped by the intersecting axes of caste and religion — two enduring hierarchies that continue to animate political life in contemporary India. Among the major political players, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has emerged as the most adept at harnessing these structures into a cohesive ideological framework. At the heart of this framework lies _Hindutva_{% sidenote 'hindutva' 'Hindutva, meaning "Hinduness," is a political ideology formulated by V.D. Savarkar in the 1920s. It defines the Indian nation primarily in terms of Hindu cultural, civilizational, and territorial identity, asserting that only those who regard India as both their fatherland (pitrubhumi) and holy land (punyabhumi) can truly be considered Indian. This ideology underpins the worldview of the RSS and BJP, advocating cultural nationalism and often criticized for excluding non-Hindu minorities.' %}, a term coined by V.D. Savarkar, which envisions a cultural Hindu unity that seeks to absorb caste differences under the banner of religious nationalism.

Historically regarded as an upper-caste stronghold, the BJP has, over the past two decades, embarked on a deliberate campaign to court Dalit voters — communities long marginalized within the Brahmanical Hindu order. This is not merely a matter of electoral arithmetic. Rather, it is a calculated cultural project: one that reworks local Dalit symbols, appropriates subaltern myths, and recasts caste-based exclusions in religious terms.

Though the 2024 general elections saw a slight dip in Dalit support for the BJP, the broader arc of transformation remains undeniable. The party has made significant inroads among Dalit communities through welfare schemes, symbolic temple-building, and the mythic elevation of caste heroes like Suhaldev or Shabari into the saffron pantheon. Such efforts do not erase caste — but they aim to _ritualize_ and _redeploy_ it, rebranding Dalit identity within the imagined unity of a Hindu Rashtra.

This essay explores the BJP’s strategies for Dalit incorporation — both material and symbolic — and assesses the extent to which these efforts have succeeded in reshaping Dalit political behavior and cultural affiliation. While the project remains incomplete and often resisted from within, it marks a crucial shift in how caste and religion are being mobilized in modern Indian politics.

## Religion in India

India is home to one of the most religiously diverse populations in the world. According to the 2011 Census, 79.8% of Indians identify as Hindu, followed by 14.2% Muslims, 2.3% Christians, 1.7% Sikhs, 0.7% Buddhists, and 0.4% Jains. Each religion often has strong regional roots — Sikhism is concentrated in Punjab, Islam has large followings in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Kerala, while Christianity is prominent in the Northeast states including Meghalaya and Nagaland, and also parts of Kerala and Goa.

Religion also plays a significant role in Indian politics and social structure. Since the colonial period, religious identity has been closely tied to electoral representation, particularly following divisive reforms like the Indian Councils Act of 1909, which introduced separate electorates for Hindus and Muslims. In the post-independence era, the rise of the Hindutva ideology and the influence of the BJP have further complicated the religious landscape. Issues such as religious conversions, communal violence, and temple politics — such as the Ram Janmabhoomi movement{% sidenote 'babri1992' 'The Ram Janmabhoomi movement culminated in the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 by Hindu nationalist mobs, claiming it stood on the birthplace of the god Ram. This event triggered nationwide communal riots and remains a major flashpoint in Indian politics.' %} — have become central to political discourse. Caste-based politics sometimes intersects with religious identity, with the Constitution offering affirmative action for Scheduled Castes and Tribes, while simultaneously sparking debates over discrimination and political appeasement. Political parties, both national and regional, are frequently accused of vote bank politics—tailoring policies and support to specific religious or caste groups for electoral gain, as seen in controversies ranging from the Shah Bano case{% sidenote 'shahbano' 'The Shah Bano case (1985) involved a Muslim woman’s fight for alimony after divorce, which triggered a national debate over secularism, Muslim personal law, and minority rights in India.' %} to the aftermath of the 2002 Gujarat violence{% sidenote 'gujarat2002' 'The 2002 Gujarat violence refers to a series of anti-Muslim riots that erupted after the burning of a train in Godhra. The state government, led by then-Chief Minister Narendra Modi, faced widespread criticism for failing to stop the violence.' %}.

## Caste in India

The caste system in India is a deeply entrenched socio-religious structure that has historically defined access to power, privilege, and resources. Though often traced to the ancient _varna_ framework of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras — with Dalits and Adivasis outside the system — its real-world manifestation is far more complex and localized, taking form through thousands of _jātis_. These caste affiliations regulate not only ritual purity and occupation but also marriage, residence, and political identity. While anthropologists such as Louis Dumont have described caste as a holistic, hierarchical order anchored in Brahminical values, some scholars including M. N. Srinivas and Christophe Jaffrelot have highlighted the dynamics of change within it — especially through the dual processes of _Sanskritization_ and _Ethnicization_. The former refers to lower castes imitating the customs of higher castes to gain upward social mobility within the Hindu order, while the latter represents a rejection of that order altogether, instead promoting distinct, often oppositional, caste-based identities and histories that seek social equality and autonomy.

Jaffrelot draws attention to how the British colonial administration helped solidify and transform caste identities. The introduction of the census, particularly, encouraged caste groups to organize themselves into associations to negotiate and enhance their status in official records. These caste associations were secularized over time, morphing into interest groups that lobbied for benefits such as educational and employment reservations. The colonial land settlement systems also played a major role in shaping regional caste dynamics. In North India, the British implemented the _zamindari_ system, recognizing large landholders as intermediaries, which often reinforced hierarchical social structures. In contrast, the South saw the implementation of the _raiyatwari_ system, where individual cultivators were made direct taxpayers—fostering relatively more egalitarian rural structures. This divergence intersected with longstanding cultural differences: the North retained a caste structure closer to the classical _varna_ model, while the South, with its historically weaker representation of Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, experienced a faster and more successful rise of low-caste movements through the process of _Ethnicization_. These movements forged collective identities and alternative histories that challenged Brahminical supremacy more effectively in the South and West than in the Hindi heartland, where the ethos of _Sanskritization_ remained more resilient.

## Politics in India

Indian politics has undergone significant transformations since independence in 1947, evolving from a secular, socialist-oriented framework dominated by the Indian National Congress to a more culturally nationalist and identity-driven terrain in recent decades. The early decades of the republic emphasized national integration, non-alignment, and social justice, with efforts to uplift marginalized castes through affirmative action and protect religious minorities under a secular constitution. However, beginning in the late 20th century, these ideals came under strain with the rise of the BJP, which emerged from the broader Hindu nationalist movement rooted in organizations like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Jan Sangh. The 1990s marked a watershed moment: the implementation of the Mandal Commission’s caste-based reservations for OBCs sparked intense political realignments, while the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 signaled the growing centrality of religion in electoral politics.

Since 2014, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP has consolidated power nationally by blending economic promises with an assertive _Hindutva_ ideology, reshaping the political narrative around cultural nationalism. This has involved not only the symbolic elevation of Hindu identity through temple construction and mythology but also legal and policy changes — such as the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and anti-conversion laws — that disproportionately affect Muslims and other minorities. Simultaneously, the BJP has restructured caste politics by incorporating large sections of OBCs and Scheduled Castes into a broad-based Hindu political identity, often at the expense of the more radical caste-based social justice movements. This fusion of religion and caste into a coherent electoral strategy marks a distinct shift from earlier forms of Indian pluralism, reflecting deeper ideological changes in the nature of democratic participation in the country.

## Dalit Politics in India

Historically, Dalits in North India — especially in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar — have held fragmented yet resilient identities, shaped by experiences of caste-based exclusion, oral traditions, and community struggles for dignity. Their politics, deeply rooted in memory and resistance, often sought autonomy from Brahminical hegemony through the assertion of subaltern pride and cultural distinctiveness.

As Badri Narayan explains in Fascinating Hindutva, Dalit mobilization prior to the Hindutva surge was largely autonomous. Movements like the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) foregrounded historical grievances, invoked symbols like Ambedkar, and celebrated lesser-known Dalit heroines of the 1857 revolt (Jhalkaribai, Udadevi) to craft a counter-history to dominant caste narratives. Dalit autobiographies and folklore offered a dual function: as personal testimonies and as a collective archive of suffering, pride, and resistance. These memories undergirded a distinctly political identity — one that demanded justice, not just recognition.

Since the 1980s, however, the BJP has gradually intervened in this cultural terrain, co-opting Dalit myths into a broader Hindu-nationalist frame. What began as localized memory has been retooled into a saffronized canon — what Narayan calls a process of “discovery, re-mythicization, and ritual implantation.” Caste heroes once marginal have been recast as Hindu warriors: Suhaldev becomes the slayer of Ghāzī Miyān; Shabari, the ideal bhakt of Rāma; Salhes, a reincarnation of Rāma himself. These reimagined narratives then materialize in melās, calendars, padyātrās, and temple inaugurations — all stamped with saffron aesthetics and BJP symbolism.

But symbolic inclusion does not imply structural change. Dalits may now officiate at local temples or receive municipal favors from BJP leaders, yet the lived realities of caste exclusion — segregated seating, separate feasts, lynchings — persist. Where saffron campaigns are strongest, electoral gains have followed: BJP tallies in SC-reserved constituencies rose notably from 2004 to 2019. Still, the very success of this strategy reveals its limits. In regions where Ambedkarite, Leftist, or Christian counter-traditions remain robust — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala — saffronization stalls, exposing its dependence on cultural voids.

Even beyond the BJP, this symbolic logic has permeated Indian politics. Mayawati’s 2007 “social engineering” drew praise from the RSS for pairing Ambedkar with Ganesh; Congress and SP have adopted caste-specific rituals in response. The result is an arms race of symbolic appeasement, where textbook edits and statue unveilings now substitute for substantive redistribution.

If anything, the success of the BJP’s Dalit outreach is due less to ideological persuasion than to its ability to offer spectacle, belonging, and patronage — especially in the absence of a strong material base. As Anand Teltumbde notes, this convergence of neoliberal withdrawal and saffron patronage redefines Dalit aspiration through market-friendly, nationalist idioms that leave caste untouched. The Dalit who joins a Ram Navami parade may gain visibility, but often at the cost of reinforcing the very system that once excluded them.

In sum, while religion has proven remarkably effective at reframing caste identities within a larger Hindu nationalist project, it has not — and arguably cannot — resolve the contradictions embedded in the caste order itself. Every newly garlanded statue of Suhaldev brings both symbolic empowerment and a risk: that of being enlisted into a politics where caste no longer speaks the language of justice, but of discipline, loyalty, and saffron belonging.

## Incorporating Dalits

Badri Narayan outlines a strategic three-step cycle through which Dalits are folded into the Hindutva narrative: discovery, re-mythicization, and ritual implantation. It begins with RSS and VHP operatives identifying local caste heroes whose legacies command deep respect within their communities but remain relatively obscure elsewhere. Figures like Suhaldev among the Pasis of Bahraich, Shabari among the Musahars of eastern U.P., and Salhes among the Dusadhs of Bihar serve precisely because they are hyper-local — their symbolic capital can be redirected toward broader saffron objectives once reworked.

The next phase is re-mythicization. Here, the raw material of memory is re-scripted to fit the nationalist mold: Suhaldev is recast as a Muslim-slaying warrior, Shabari becomes the ideal Hindu devotee of Rāma, and Salhes is transformed into Rāma incarnate. What was once local pride becomes a building block in a pan-Hindu civilizational epic — one in which Muslim antagonists and mythic Hindu symbols provide the necessary communal charge. Finally comes ritual implantation: idols are erected, padyātrās staged, and RSS shakhas distribute calendars, badges, and saffron flags. Dalits, once excluded from temples, now march as priests and patriots — offered a version of dignity that is visibly performative, but often politically potent.

This cultural choreography is not merely symbolic; it feeds directly into electoral strategy. Suhaldev melās end with chants of “Jai Shri Rām” and appeals to vote for the BJP, while Shabari calendars circulate in Musahar hamlets, depicting her kneeling before a saffron-clad Rāma. These images do double duty: they affirm caste subordination while cloaking it in Hindu fraternity. And when the local activist who organizes a statue unveiling receives a panchayat ticket or contract in return, the transactional logic becomes clear — loyalty to saffron pays dividends. Not surprisingly, BJP success in SC-reserved constituencies across eastern U.P. and Bihar has mirrored the geographic spread of these revised legends.

But incorporation is neither total nor permanent. Symbolic inclusion often coexists with social exclusion: the same Musahar who garlands a Shabari idol may still be denied a seat at a Brahmin wedding feast. Worse, Dalit settlements often become flashpoints for communal tension. Suhaldev fairs have triggered Hindu-Muslim riots; Shabari Kumbhs in Gujarat’s Dang district preceded anti-Christian violence. The prestige offered through saffron narratives can bring with it new vulnerabilities — not emancipation, but re-inscription into conflicts choreographed by upper-caste strategists.

Nor is this script confined to the BJP. Its logic has seeped into rival parties. Mayawati’s 2007 campaign combined Ambedkar busts with Ganesh icons — a soft Hindutva the RSS praised. Congress and Samajwadi Party now host their own caste-tailored rituals, anxious not to lose symbolic ground. As a result, India’s communal temperature rises not from overt mosque-temple clashes but from textbook revisions, village processions, and icon wars.

Narayan’s ethnography confirms that the ethnicization of caste under Hindutva is powerful — but incomplete. Where ritual dignity, local patronage, and a national myth converge, Dalit identity tilts toward saffron solidarity. Where even one of these is absent, older memories of caste resistance, secular nationalism, or Ambedkarite Buddhism reassert themselves. The political outcome is not total assimilation but oscillation: a constant tug-of-war between inclusion and resistance, dignity and discipline. Religion can reframe caste — but it cannot dissolve its contradictions.

## Social Engineering: How Hindutva Reworks Dalit Identity

As Kanungo observes, Hindutva architects know that a Brahmin-centric political image cannot command electoral majorities. Instead, they turn to what Anand Teltumbde has aptly called “social engineering” — a calibrated effort to construct the illusion of Hindu unity while leaving caste hierarchy fundamentally intact. This strategy stretches back to the 1970s, when Balasaheb Deoras urged RSS shakhas to enroll Dalit children. Today, it finds institutional form in a range of outreach arms — Seva Bharati, Samajik Samarasata Manch, and temple-linked welfare trusts — all promoting a rhetoric of casteless fraternity while silently preserving the logic of varna.

At the ideological level, this project requires sanitizing B. R. Ambedkar’s radicalism. RSS publications praise him as a patriotic Hindu who opposed Muslim separatism but gloss over his scathing critique of Hindu scriptures and his ultimate embrace of Buddhism. This selective remembrance is not accidental; it’s a calculated attempt to repurpose Ambedkar as a Hindutva-compatible figure, while sidelining his structural critique of caste.

On the ground, the saffron script is written in ritual and subsidy, not scholarship. Dalit bastis in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are offered subsidized pilgrimages, saffron scarves, and minor jobs through RSS or Bajrang Dal channels. Participation in Ganesh festivals or Ram Navami parades offers what Gopal Guru describes as “glamour, public visibility, and subsidized satisfaction” — the emotional currency that state schemes or deradicalized NGO activism often lack. But this inclusion is fragile and instrumental. Caste segregation remains a daily reality: Dalits are barred from crematoria in Vaso; the 2002 lynching of leatherworkers in Jhajjar remains etched in community memory. When caste rage surfaces, sangh activists deflect it — not by addressing injustice, but by framing such dissent as a threat to Hindu familial order.

The trade-off is stark. Dalits who marched in Ayodhya or participated in the 2002 Gujarat pogrom may have gained short-term pride or economic benefit, but they did so by reinforcing a hierarchy that repositions Muslims as the “new untouchables.” This is the ideological sleight-of-hand that fuses Hindutva with neoliberalism: just as the public sector retreats and Ambedkarite autonomy withers, saffron networks offer patronage as the only viable lifeline. Teltumbde warns that this convergence produces a Social-Darwinist vision of Hindu supremacy — one where only the most disciplined, majoritarian collective is fit to thrive in global capitalism.

Understanding this convergence is critical for any counter-movement. If Hindutva thrives by filling the vacuum left by fragmented Dalit politics and retreating welfare institutions, then the path forward must involve rebuilding solidarities across caste lines, defending public employment guarantees, and restoring the radical force of Ambedkar’s critique. Without such a strategy, the promise of Hinduized dignity will continue to mask a deeper entrenchment of inequality — one in which Dalits are symbolically absorbed into the Hindu fold, yet structurally kept outside the circle of real power.

## Conclusion and Remarks

Dalit incorporation into Hindutva has progressed through what Badri Narayan describes as a cycle of discovery, re-mythicization, and ritual implantation — a cultural script in which local heroes are rebranded as defenders of Hindu civilization and embedded into saffron ceremonies and welfare networks. Where this choreography has taken root — in regions like eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Gujarat — the BJP has reaped significant electoral gains, suggesting that caste identity can be strategically “ethnicized” when reframed through religious nationalism.

Yet this incorporation is neither seamless nor emancipatory. Symbolic inclusion does not eliminate structural exclusion. Even as Dalits gain visibility through saffron narratives, they remain vulnerable to both everyday discrimination and communal manipulation. The very process that offers them dignity often deepens their dependence on upper-caste political scripting — offering ritual recognition without altering the foundational hierarchies they have long resisted.

This project is deeply problematic. The BJP’s appropriation of Dalit icons and its selective invocation of Ambedkar constitute an ideological sleight-of-hand — one that neutralizes Dalit resistance while projecting an illusion of unity. It exploits historical pain not to redress it, but to reroute it into a nationalist framework that ultimately sustains the very inequalities it claims to transcend. The saffronization of caste is not a solution to caste oppression — it is a repackaging of it.

If this process continues unchecked, Dalit political agency risks being reduced to cultural compliance. The real test lies not in how many statues are built or how many fairs are held, but in whether the state delivers material justice, equitable representation, and genuine autonomy to Dalit communities. Until then, the promise of Hindutva remains hollow. It may claim to reincorporate caste — but it cannot resolve the contradictions that caste continues to generate in Indian democracy. And it is precisely in these contradictions that the next struggle for Dalit dignity must be fought.

## Potential Changes: What Could Reshape Dalit Politics in the Future?

While the BJP’s project of incorporating Dalits into the Hindutva fold has made strategic gains, several looming developments threaten to disrupt this carefully managed synthesis. At the center of this is the demand for a national caste census — a potentially transformative event that could destabilize the ideological foundations of saffron unity.

A caste census would make the numerical strength of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and OBCs publicly visible, raising difficult questions about the mismatch between population size and representation in jobs, education, and political office. For Dalit communities, this data could legitimize longstanding demands for proportional redistribution. For the BJP, however, the census threatens to re-politicize caste in ways that cut across its Hindu-first narrative. While the party has elevated individual Dalit icons and offered symbolic recognition, it has consistently resisted the structural reckoning that a caste census implies.

This tension could prove explosive. If the state delays or dilutes the census, it may spark widespread backlash — particularly from young Dalits and OBCs who are increasingly organized, digitally connected, and politically assertive. Such a rupture could also energize regional parties with deep caste-based constituencies, leading to new coalitions and electoral realignments that blunt the BJP’s dominance.

Other potential flashpoints are emerging as well. The rollback of affirmative action, privatization of public-sector jobs, and the criminalization of inter-caste relationships (especially under anti-conversion{% sidenote 'anti-conversion' 'Anti-conversion laws are state-level laws in India intended to prevent religious conversions by force, fraud, or inducement. Critics argue they are often used to harass religious minorities and restrict individual freedom of belief.' %}
and "love jihad"{% sidenote 'love-jihad' '"Love jihad" is a controversial and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory alleging that Muslim men court Hindu women to convert them to Islam through marriage. It has been used to justify restrictive laws and vigilante actions in several Indian states.' %}
 laws) all intersect with Dalit realities. These policies may provoke renewed mobilization, particularly if economic precarity deepens and political space narrows. The symbolic inclusion offered by Hindutva may no longer suffice in a climate where structural inequality becomes more visible and harder to ignore.

In short, Dalit politics stands at a crossroads. The current phase — marked by saffronized myths and ritual visibility — may soon give way to a more contentious and structural battle over representation, rights, and dignity. Whether that battle is led by grassroots movements, regional alliances, or a rejuvenated Ambedkarite imagination remains to be seen.
