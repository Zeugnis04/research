## Project Overview

This capstone project for the SNU Integrated Design of Civil Engineering Systems course focuses on developing comprehensive Low Impact Development (LID) strategies for sustainable stormwater management across Seoul National University's campus.

## Background

Urban development has increased impervious surfaces, leading to:
- Increased stormwater runoff volumes
- Higher peak flow rates
- Reduced groundwater recharge
- Water quality degradation
- Urban heat island effects

LID strategies can help mitigate these issues while providing additional benefits such as water conservation and ecosystem services.

## Project Scope

### Campus Hydrology Analysis
- Detailed mapping of existing drainage systems
- Identification of problem areas (flooding, erosion)
- Quantification of current runoff patterns
- Assessment of soil infiltration rates

### LID Technology Evaluation
- **Bioswales**: Vegetated channels for runoff conveyance and treatment
- **Rain Gardens**: Shallow depressions that collect and infiltrate stormwater
- **Permeable Pavement**: Porous surfaces allowing water infiltration
- **Green Roofs**: Vegetated roof systems for runoff reduction
- **Cisterns**: Rainwater harvesting for irrigation reuse

## Methodology

### Site Assessment
1. Campus-wide survey of existing conditions
2. Topographic analysis using GIS mapping
3. Soil permeability testing at key locations
4. Rainfall data analysis for design storm events

### Design Development
1. Cost-benefit analysis of different LID options
2. Optimal placement strategy using spatial analysis
3. Integration with existing campus infrastructure
4. Maintenance requirements assessment

### Water Reuse System
- Rainwater collection and storage design
- Distribution system for landscape irrigation
- Water quality treatment considerations
- System automation and monitoring

## Expected Benefits

- 30-50% reduction in stormwater runoff volume
- Reduced strain on municipal drainage systems
- Potential for research and education opportunities
- Long-term maintenance cost savings

## Timeline

**September 2025**: Literature review and site assessment  
**October 2025**: Hydrological modeling and design development  
**November 2025**: Cost analysis and implementation planning  
**December 2025**: Final presentation and report submission

## Future Implementation

The project aims to provide SNU with a practical roadmap for sustainable campus development that could serve as a model for other universities in Korea and the region.

*This project is part of the Civil Engineering Systems Design course and will be completed in December 2025.*
