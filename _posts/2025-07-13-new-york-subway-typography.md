{% newthought 'I have a passion for typography.' %} I will be staying in New York till late August, and had some time to go around the city for a few days. I thought I would somehow archive some of the typographic stuff I've seen in the system.

The New York subway system features diverse typographic elements from historical mosaics to the iconic Helvetica service bullets and signage. Below are probably the most typical typography one would expect from NYC subway trains. 

First of them are service labels which usually feature Helvetica with inside a single colored circle/diamond.

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/new-york-subway-typography/n-subway.jpg' 'Arrived N train at 57th Street--Seventh Avenue station'%}
{% maincolumn 'assets/img/new-york-subway-typography/s-subway.jpg' 'S train at Grand Central--42nd Street station'%}

Next are signage on station entraces or column structures.

Last are some printed posters from the MTA.

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/new-york-subway-typography/printed-sign.jpg' 'Printed signs in 42nd Street--Port Authority Bus Terminal station'%}

So, as seen in most of the signage/posters above, MTA currently seems to prioritize the use of Helvetica. This is [a good article from the New York Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/how-helvetica-took-over-the-subway/) about how Helvetica took over the subway --- and surprisingly the domination of Helvetica is rather a new thing considering how old the typeface is. 

The typeface that was dominant before is actually Standard{% sidenote '' "Akzidenz-Grotesk, a sans serif typeface from Berlin's Berthold foundry (1898), was imported to the U.S. by Amsterdam Continental as Standard."%}. According to some, service bullets featuring Standard is still fairly widespread (which I haven't yet seen one) and you can still find some remaining signage featuring Standard.

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/new-york-subway-typography/53st-standard-2.jpg' 'Lexington Avenue/51st Street station plaza exit'%}

Finally there are more historical signs including mosaics, monograms, or *serif* lettering found too.
