# My version of jekyll-theme-tufte

## *A modern Jekyll theme based on [tufte-css](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css)*

Originally *jekyll-theme-tufte* is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static website theme inspired by the text design of Edward
Tufte. It is enabled by [*tufte-css*](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css),
a CSS file providing the Tufte styles. I have made some customizations and added some features to use in my blog.

This is a gem-packaged theme that can be easily installed by including
*jekyll-theme-tufte* in your `Gemfile`.

Large portions of the theme are derived from prior work to bring *tufte-css* to Jekyll, including:

* [*tufte-css-jekyll*](https://github.com/sdruskat/tufte-css-jekyll), a classic-style Jekyll theme
* [*tufte-jekyll*](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll), a classic-style theme with a lot of extra visual stuff added
* [*tufte-pandoc-jekyll*](https://github.com/jez/tufte-pandoc-jekyll), a gem-style theme that uses pandoc under the hood
* [*ET-Jekyll*](https://github.com/bradleytaunt/ET-Jekyll), a classic-style theme that makes a number of CSS changes

This theme is minimalist and tries to stick closely to the original tufte-css styles. As a gem-based theme, it is also easier to install and manage compared to classic style themes. (Classic Jekyll themes are installed by mixing all the files in with your siteâ€™s files, which creates a big mess.)

This theme is responsive and adapts to desktop and mobile screens. (Margin notes
are displayed inline on narrow screens.) It also supports dark mode detection
via `prefers-color-scheme`, looking good on dark and light backgrounds alike.
